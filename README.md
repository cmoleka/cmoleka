### Description
Hi there! I'm currently working on a project called Golooka, and I'm excited to tell you all about it. Golooka is a job platform that aims to connect talented individuals with employers, all while making the job search process a whole lot easier.

One of the main objectives of this project is to tackle the challenges around employment search in places like Central Africa, where job hunting is primarily done through word of mouth. Unfortunately, this approach can perpetuate unemployment and make it even harder for people to find work. With Golooka, I want to create a platform that provides a modern user interface and leverages the latest technologies to make employment search more accessible, efficient, and fair.
